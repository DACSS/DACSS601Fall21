# Hello, my name is Megan Georges.
I will be practicing some R coding with the PlantGrowth dataset. 

***

### Here are the first ten rows of the PlantGrowth dataset.

```{r}
data("PlantGrowth")
head(PlantGrowth, 10)
```

***

### The PlantGrowth dataset has `r nrow(PlantGrowth)` rows and `r ncol(PlantGrowth)` columns.

***

### Here are the summary statistics:

```{r}
summary(PlantGrowth)
```
***

### Here is a plot:

```{r}
plot(PlantGrowth)
```

***

# The End!
