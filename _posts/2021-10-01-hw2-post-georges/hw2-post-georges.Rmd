## Practice reading in data

I will be using the 2012 US Railroad Employment dataset. This data breaks down US railroad employment in 2012 by state and county.

```{r}
Railroad <- read.csv("../../_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv")
```

## Descriptive Statistics

Below is some information on the railroad dataset.

```{r}
colnames(Railroad)
summary(Railroad)
