## Introduction

Hello, my name is Kirsten Johnson. I am going to try out some basic math in R.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First, I'll create two variables, v1 and v2.

```{r}
v1= 119
v2= 64
```
Next, I'll try out some math using these variables.

### Addition

```{r}
v1+v2
```
### Subtration

```{r}
v1-v2
```

### Multiplication

```{r}
v1*v2
```

### Division

```{r}
v1/v2
```


I'm very excited to try out more functions in R!
