## Introduction
Hello everyone! My name is Allyson Beach. I have never used R before this course, but am excited to learn more about it. I am in my final semester in the CS masters program. For this first post, I will plot some simulated data. 

## Objective 
We will create a vector through the sequence function from 1 to 10 by increments of 1 (default). We will then plot this data with ggplot2 package as a function of y = 2x. 

## Data
```{r data}
x <- seq(1, 10)
x
y <- x*2
y
```
We can also change the x data to be incremented by 2.

```{r data2}
x <- seq(1,20, 2)
x
y <- x*2
y
```
Here we will plot the data using the ggplot2 package. 

```{r plot}
figure <- ggplot2::qplot(x,y)
show(figure)
```
